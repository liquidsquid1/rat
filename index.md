# General
If you are reading this, you are probably ratted! This is a very important document, so do not skip it. **YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS AT RISK**

## First step:
Maybe you should have tried [xenons epic rat removal guide](https://xenonorsomething.github.io/RatRemoval) first before following these steps :wink:

## What is a RAT?
A RAT (Remote Access Trojan) is used by bad actors (we call them skids round 'ere) that are used to pull as much personal information from your PC as possible.
These RAT's can contain:
- Cookie and Password logger
- IP address tracker
- AntiVirus site blocker (see COMING SOON)
- Webcam Stream

## I'm scared, how do I remove it?

Follow any of these guides for the RATS:

- Rat Removal (Recommended) [Your Average Rat Removal Guide](https://liquidsquid1.github.io/rat-removal/rats/generic)
- Blank Grabber Removal (Recommended) [BlankGrabber Removal Guide](https://liquidsquid1.github.io/rat-removal/rats/blankgrabber)

## THATS NOT EVERYTHING!

Some rat creators are smart enough to hide it fully, in that case you would need a **full factory reset**. Please grab your nearest USB stick and perform a clean install of windows

### thats not it?

[Some rats hide in UEFI BIOSes.](https://www.kaspersky.co.uk/blog/logofail-uefi-vulnerabilities/27098/) Mostly, you're screwed. Good luck getting out of this one.
