## What is a RAT?
A RAT (Remote Access Trojan) is used by bad actors (we call them skids round 'ere) that are used to pull as much personal information from your PC as possible.
These RAT's can contain:
- Cookie and Password logger
- IP address tracker
- AntiVirus site blocker (see https://liquidsquid1.github.io/rat/extra/av)
- Webcam Stream
