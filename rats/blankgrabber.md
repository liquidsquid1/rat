# BlankGrabber
BlankGrabber is an easy rat to remove and recover from.

Simply (IN THIS ORDER):

## 1. Remove all startup files to ensure no persistance:
Simply hold WIN + R and search for `shell:common startup` and delete everything in there with a `.scr` extension

## 2. Remove and reset DISCORD:
This RAT tries to hide and steal from DISCORD, so you want to:
- Uninstall DISCORD through control panel
- Remove all files related to discord from %localappdata%
- Reinstall

## 3. Unblock your AntiVirus:
BlankGrabber tries to disable and bypass UAC so its best to turn it back on. This includes websites like [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com). It's so kind of BlankGrabber to provide us with an easy remove script:
